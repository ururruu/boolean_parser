class BaseBool(object):
    ''' Base class for handling conditions joined by boolean logic operators

    This class handles the parsing of boolean logic within strings. The boolean
    classes are assigned to the :py:func:`pyparsing.infixNotation` in the order of boolean
    NOTS->ANDS->ORS, i.e. ``BoolNot``-> ``BoolAnd``-> ``BoolOr``.  For example,
    the string "x > 1 and y < 2", consisting of two conditions joined by a boolean "and" gets
    parsed into "and_(x>1, y<2)", represented as "BoolAnd(Condition1, Condition2)".
    During parsing, the class extracts all conditions and parameters joined by the boolean logic
    and makes them accessible as attributes.

    Attributes:
        params: list
            A list of extracted parameters from all conditions
        conditions: list
            A list of conditions contained within the boolean clause
        logicop: str
            The boolean logic operator used to join the conditions
    '''
    logicop = None

    def __init__(self, data):
        self._get_conditions(data[0])

    def _get_conditions(self, data):
        ''' Builds the list of conditions

        Iterators over the input parsed conditions and extracts
        pyparsed clauses from boolean logic joins. Extracts pyparsed
        conditions into the ``conditions`` parameter.

        Parameters:
            data: list
                A list of underlying conditions
        '''
        self.conditions = []

                self.conditions.append(condition)
